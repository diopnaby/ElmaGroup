git clone https://github.com/your-username/ElmaGroup.git
cd ElmaGroup

# Method 2: SCP
scp -i your-key.pem -r ./ElmaGroup ubuntu@your-ec2-ip:/home/ubuntu/
```

### Step 2: Run Deployment Script
```bash
# On EC2 instance
chmod +x deploy_ec2.sh
./deploy_ec2.sh
```

### Step 3: Configure Environment
```bash

MAIL_USERNAME=your-email
MAIL_PASSWORD=your-app-password
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@yourdomain.com
```

### Step 4: SSL Certificate
```bash
# After DNS is pointed to your server
./ssl_setup.sh yourdomain.com
```

### Step 5: Performance Optimization
```bash
# Optional but recommended
./optimize_performance.sh
```
